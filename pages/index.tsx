            I'm a Software Engineer. Growing as a developer can be lonely and
            challenging sometimes, I document my ups and downs here to hopefully
            motivate you. If you're looking for help or just a friend,{" "}

              feel free to DM me on Twitter

            , I'll reply as soon as possible.

            <p>
              In my newsletter, I share early and behind-the-scene look into
              what Iâ€™m working on and learning about software development. Most
              importantly, it's a way for you and me to establish a closer
              relationship and hopefully can help each other in the future.
