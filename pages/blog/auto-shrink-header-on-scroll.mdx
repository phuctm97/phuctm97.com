# Auto Shrink Header On Scroll in React

I've always liked this effect: keep the header of your website sticky then
auto-shrink and blur when users scroll down.

![Demo][demo]

Today, I finally got some free time to implement it for [my website], so I'm
writing this article hopefully to help you do the same for yours if you also
like it 😉.

## Motivations

There're 2 primary motivations that makes me love this effect:

- You can put a couple of calls to action (CTAs), then as your users are reading
  content on your website, they keep seeing these CTAs, which can increase the
  odds that they'll click them. I like to keep links to [my
  newsletter][my website] and [Twitter][my twitter] here. _(An extra tip that I
  like to do here is to make a little animation or transition that occasionally
  runs to remind the user's the CTAs)_

- I want to optimize for CTAs but I don't want users on my website to have bad
  experience, which is actually even more important. To avoid bad UX, the header
  shouldn't take too much space, especially when users are reading the main
  content.

## How-to

### Basic idea

The basic idea is to subscribe to `onscroll` event of the browser, then check if
the user scrolls pass a certain offset and update CSS of the header component
arcordingly.

### Subscribe to `onscroll` using hook

```ts
const Header = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = () => {
      // Check and update component here.
    };

    window.addEventListener("scroll", handler);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("scroll", handler);
  }, []);

  // return <Component ... />
};
```

Use `useEffect` hook to subscribe to event `onscroll` when the component is
mounted (notice the last parameter `[]`), also remember to return an unsubscribe
function when the component is unmounted to avoid memory leaks.

### Check for scroll position

```ts
const Header = () => {
  const [isShrunk, setShrunk] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = () => {
      setShrunk((isShrunk) => {
        if (
          !isShrunk &&
          (document.body.scrollTop > 20 ||
            document.documentElement.scrollTop > 20)
        ) {
          return true;
        }

        if (
          isShrunk &&
          document.body.scrollTop < 4 &&
          document.documentElement.scrollTop < 4
        ) {
          return false;
        }

        return isShrunk;
      });
    };

    // Previous logic.
  }, []);

  // return <Component isShrunk={isShrunk} />
};
```

Notice `setShrunk` is called with a function instead of just pure value, this
pattern helps ensure we are checking against the lastest previous value. Also,
there are a _gap_ between offsets to shrink and to expand (`20` and `4`), this
helps avoid flashing of changed styles.

That's it. I hope it helps. [Check out the full source code][header src] to see
more details.
