To maximize distributions of my blog posts with zero effort, I'm writing a bot
to distribute all my posts to [DEV.to] using [their API][dev.to api].

## Requirements

- Every article without a `dev.to id` attribute in its frontmatter should be
  detected and automatically distributed in a timely manner.

- After an article is distributed, a commit adding `dev.to id` and `dev.to url`
  should be generated and pushed to the repo.

- Every commit updating an article pushed to `master` should trigger an update
  to the corresponding article on DEV.to.

## How?

Because I host my repository on Github, the obvious option is to use [Github
Actions]. There is another option is to write a [Github Bot], which gives me
more control but gonna be more complicated and introduces some small cost. I
decided to go with Github Actions because I don't need a lot of control now,
just need to get things done in the cheapest way possible, Github Actions is
also free (for open-source).

### Workflow

- Create a Github workflow called `DEV.to Distribution` runs daily.

- The workflow checks if there's an article without `dev.to id` frontmatter.

- For each article that doesn't have `dev.to id`, the workflow calls the DEV.to
  API to create a corresponding article, retrieves resulted `dev.to id` and
  `dev.to url`, updates the MDX's frontmatter, creates a commit, and pushes it
  to `master`.

### Implementation

To make scripting easier, I'll write everything in Node.js, the Github workflow
simply run `yarn` and `yarn distribute:dev.to`. `yarn distribute:dev.to` calls
`node scripts/distribute-devto.js`, where all the logic will be written.
