To maximize distributions of my blog posts with zero effort, I'm writing a bot
to distribute all my posts to [DEV.to] using [their API][dev.to api].

## Requirements

- Every article without a `dev.to id` attribute in its frontmatter should be
  detected and automatically distributed in a schedulable manner.

- After an article is distributed, a commit adding `dev.to id` and `dev.to url`
  should be generated and pushed to the repo.

- Every commit updating an article pushed to `master` should trigger an update
  to the corresponding article on DEV.to.

## How?

Because I host my repository on Github, the obvious option is to use Github
Actions. There is another option is to write a Github Bot, which gives me more
control but gonna be more complicated and introduces some small cost. I decided
to go with Github Actions because I don't need a lot of control now, just need
to get things done in the cheapest way possible, Github Actions is also free
(for open-source).
