Today I created a small Unified/Remark plugin called [remark-parse-frontmatter]
to help easily parse frontmatter in a Markdown or MDX document using either
[mdxjs] or [remarkjs] or [unifiedjs].

In case you don't know what is Unified/Remark is, Unified provides an interface
for processing content like Markdown, HTML, JSX, etc, in an extremly modular
design which allows writing and using plugins easy (but sometimes also feel a
bit fragmented).

## What is frontmatter in Markdown?

Frontmatter is the first block in a Markdown document that starts and ends with
a line `---`. Frontmatter defines a Markdown document's metadata.

For example, this is the frontmatter of this article you're reading:

```md

Markdown frontmatter is supported by Github and most popular code editors which
help writing and maintaining them more fun.

## Parse frontmatter with remark-parse-frontmatter

[remark-parse-frontmatter] provides 2 essential features when working with
frontmatter:

- Parses the YAML content of a markdown and turns that into a JavaScript object
  for usage.

- Validates the object using [revalidator].

This plugin requires plugin `remark-frontmatter` to be applied first (which
reads the text and turns into a syntax tree, not a JSON object, and has no
validation).

```js
const processor = remark()
  .use(require("remark-frontmatter"))
  .use(require("remark-parse-frontmatter"))
  .freeze();

const file = processor.processSync(`
---
title: Hello, World!
---
`);

console.log(file.data.frontmatter);
```

⬇️

```
{
  title: "Hello, World!"
}
```

Remember to first install the plugin:

```bash
yarn add remark-parse-frontmatter
```

Check out [the NPM package][remark npm] and [the plugin's
repository][remark-parse-frontmatter] for more details.
