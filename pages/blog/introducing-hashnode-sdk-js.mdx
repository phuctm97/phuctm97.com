In order to implement an [auto-crosspost workflow] for [my website], I created a
TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for working with [Hashnode] blogging platform. It's
built around [Hashnode API].

There're several reasons for it:

- Hashnode public API is still in alpha and subject to breaking changes.
  Experience using is a bit messy (what to expect in an alpha API), I had to
  write several workaround-like functions. To make my website implementation
  more relevant and easier to maintain, I need a stable API as well as
  separating as much non-relevant codebase as possible.

- The [Hashnode Christmas hackathon].

- It's gonna be interesting if Hashnode collaborate on this, use in their
  product, make it official, as their first step open-sourcing their product.

## Key concepts

- Opinionated, has its own interfaces focusing on common blogging features, e.g.
  CRUD articles, comments, etc (_what you usually do on Hashnode_).

- Abstracts away Hashnode API, which is currently in alpha and subject to
  breaking changes. Whereas, this SDK's API is **considerably stable**, its API
  won't change without a major release. As soon as Hashnode API changes, it will
  be updated to keep its API remain unchanged and function correctly.

- **Not** flexible by design, you can't query less or more fields, these use
  cases are covered by Hashnode GraphQL API.

## How & why?

I am actively using this SDK in [my website] to implement an [auto-crosspost
workflow], which runs daily. Hence, as soon as something breaks, I'll recognize
and try to fix as soon as possible. Check out [this workflow run] to see how it
is used in practice.

## Usage

### Install

```bash
yarn add hashnode-sdk-js
```

### API

#### Configure API key

Go to Hashnode account settings, create an API key and set it as environment
variable `HASHNODE_API_KEY` at where you run your application, the SDK will
automatically use it.

#### Find a user by username

```js
import hashnode from "hashnode-sdk-js";

hashnode.findUser("phuctm97").then((data) => console.log(data));
```

```
{
  id: '5fa3f68b47631a19e811f076',
  username: 'phuctm97',
  name: 'Minh-Phuc Tran',
  tagline: 'Engineer üë®üèª‚Äçüíª. Building open-source tools and tutorials ‚û°Ô∏è twitter.com/phuctm97',
  publication: {
    id: '5fa565080163314ab6d7deab',
    name: "Minh-Phuc Tran's Blog",
    domain: 'blog.phuctm97.com'
  }
}
```

#### Other examples

See [more examples][sdk examples].

#### Types

```ts
export type Publication = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  domain: string;
};

export type User = {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  name: string;
  tagline: string;
  publication: Publication;
};

export type Article = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  url: string;
  canonicalURL?: string;
  contentMarkdown: string;
};
```

## Features

- Find user.

- Get a user's publication.

- Create an article in a publication.

- Update an article in a publication.
