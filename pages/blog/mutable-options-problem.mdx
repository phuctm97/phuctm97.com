# MDX (Unified) Mutating Options Object Cost Me 2 Hours

A couple of days ago, I got into a very annoying issue while using [MDX] in [my
Next.js website][my website]. It cost me almost 2 hours to resolve.

## Context

First, let's quickly go through some technical concepts in case you didn't work
with MDX and Next.js a lot:

- MDX is essentially a set of [unified] plugins. [unified] is a generic
  interface for processing content as structured data. Thanks to this, I was
  able to write granular plugins to customize how I use MDX quite extensively.

- Next.js is built on top of Webpack and loads MDX from a Webpack loader
  (`@mdx-js/loader`).

- I have different plugins and configurations for different MDX documents based
  on their file paths so that I can have custom syntaxes for different types of
  documents.

In order to achieve that I have a custom Next.js plugin that will resolve into
different MDX options for different documents:

```js:next.config.js
const configureMDX = ({ realResource }) => {
  if (realResource.startsWith(folders.blog)) return configs.blog;
  if (realResource.startsWith(folders.cheatsheet)) return configs.cheatsheet;
  return configs.base;
};

module.exports = (next = {}) =>
  Object.assign({}, next, {
    webpack(config, appOptions) {
      config.module.rules.push({
        test: /\.(md|mdx)$/,
        use: (info) => [
          appOptions.defaultLoaders.babel,
          {
            loader: require.resolve("@mdx-js/loader"),
            options: configureMDX(info),
          },
        ],
      });

      if (typeof next.webpack === "function") {
        return next.webpack(config, appOptions);
      }

      return config;
    },
  });
```

`configs.base`, `configs.blog`, and `configs.cheatsheet` are just typical MDX
options:

```js:configs/base.js
module.exports = {
  remarkPlugins: [
    frontmatter,
    parseFrontmatter,
    [
      extractFrontmatter,
      {
        title: { type: "string" },
        description: { type: "string" },
      },
    ],
    unwrapTexts,
    titleFromContents,
    descriptionFromContents,
    pageURLElements,
    [namedExports, ["title", "description", "url", "path", "folder", "slug"]],
  ],
  rehypePlugins: [prism, a11yEmojis],
};
```

```js:configs/blog.js
module.exports = {
  remarkPlugins: [
    frontmatter,
    parseFrontmatter,
    [
      extractFrontmatter,
      {
        title: { type: "string" },
        description: { type: "string" },
        date: { type: "string", format: "date", required: true },
        tags: {
          type: "array",
          items: { type: "string", minLength: 1, required: true },
          uniqueItems: true,
          maxItems: 4,
        },
        cover: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            url: { type: "string", format: "url" },
            icons: {
              type: "array",
              items: { type: "string", minLength: 1, required: true },
              uniqueItems: true,
              maxItems: 3,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
    unwrapTexts,
    titleFromContents,
    descriptionFromContents,
    pageURLElements,
    generatedCover,
    [
      namedExports,
      [
        "title",
        "description",
        "url",
        "path",
        "folder",
        "slug",
        "date",
        "tags",
        "cover",
      ],
    ],
    [defaultExport, "~/layouts/blog"],
  ],
  rehypePlugins: [prism, a11yEmojis],
};
```

It's quite natural, right? Indeed, it worked just fine with Next.js dev server.
It only failed when bulding for production.

## The issue

Basically, I used the plugin `extractFrontmatter` to both validate and expose
attributes from frontmatter as props to my layout component. Only blog documents
required `date` attribute. Nonetheless, when I built for production, all
documents required all attributes from different configurations combined! It was
as if someone merged all the configurations together before executing the build
process, despite the fact that the configuration code I wrote are completely
side-effect free - all functions are pure and just return values without
modifying anything.

I started to look into `@mdx-js/loader` code, then `@mdx-js/mdx` code, and they
all looked just fine.

So, I had to debug further to see when the options got modified (I actually just
did `console.log`).

All values returned from my `configureMDX` is correct, so there was nothing
wrong here. These values will then be sent to `@mdx-js/loader` invocations and
it was magically modified somehow right at the beginning of `@mdx-js/loader`.

I really had no idea how it worked this time and just did tons of different
guesses, made changes upon, and saw how it turned out ðŸ˜¥.

## The fix

Thank god! After ~2 hours, I had (probably) a correct guess and managed to fix
the issue.

Webpack code didn't look like modifying anything (although the logs showed
changes happened right at the beginning of a Webpack loader), MDX code didn't
look like modifying anything either, so I guessed Unified did it. I jumped into
[unified repository](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified/blob/8f135d052c9d9e5b2c4c2217815c672012e71707/index.js#L228-L240),
and... yeah, it mutated the plugin options ðŸ¥¶.

```js:unified/index.js
function addPlugin(plugin, value) {
  var entry = find(plugin);

  if (entry) {
    if (plain(entry[1]) && plain(value)) {
      value = extend(entry[1], value); // this equals Object.assign(...)
    }

    entry[1] = value;
  } else {
    attachers.push(slice.call(arguments));
  }
}
```

But really? All returned values from my `configureMDX` are correct, when this
mutation takes place? I'm still not sure, at this time, I really just want to
fix the issue and get rid of it.

So, to avoid the mutation, I simply changed my configuration code from objects
to functions returning the object, this way all mutations will be discarded:

```js:next.config.js
const configureMDX = ({ realResource }) => {
  if (realResource.startsWith(folders.blog)) return configs.blog();
  if (realResource.startsWith(folders.cheatsheet)) return configs.cheatsheet();
  return configs.base();
};
```

My guess was that Next.js or Webpack resolves configurations for every file
before invoking loaders, this way all values returned by `configureMDX` are
correct before going into loaders, then right after the first loader execution,
it got mutated.

## Final thought

This post isn't to blame anyone, I really enjoy using the Unified and MDX so
far, and I appreciate the authors' works a lot. This post is just a rare story
that I think other developer folks may find interesting. The lesson from this is
to **implement your code in a way that as side-effect free as possible**,
because it makes the flow crystal clear and intuitive, side effects make
debugging very hard! When you can't avoid side effects, make sure to document
and highlight it!
