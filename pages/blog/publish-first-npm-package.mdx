# Publish My First NPM TypeScript Package

While I'm building [my website/blog][my website], there are a few things that I
see can be useful to separate and publish as 3rd packages - the biggest
motivation is to tear down my codebase and avoid maintaining as much irrelevant
code as possible.

So, I decided it's a good chance to learn, create, publish my first NPM package
ever, and finally share to motivate and help others üéâ. Let's jump into it.

## Requirements

It is coming in 2021, I wanted to publish my NPM package in a modern-ish way so
that I can re-apply later and my packages stay relevant as long as possible, so
I put down some requirements:

- TypeScript: it has to support TypeScript. Using a package without TypeScript
  support in 2020 always feels not right for me.

- Concise documentation.

- Release workflow: takes less than 1 min. I don't want to completely automate
  this as I don't think I'll release that many times, automating seems to
  overkill a quick simple command.

- Auto-upgrade dependencies: stay up-to-date with all dependencies to avoid
  security issues, I don't want to take care of this.

- Prettier code style: standardized, zero configuration.

- Call to action. It's always good to put a note to the end of what you created
  and redirect it back to your primary online presence, I believe.

## What the package is about?

To build an automatic crosspost to DEV.to (this post you're reading is
automatically cross-posted to DEV.to when I pushed it to my website), I need to
convert my Markdown posts into a Markdown variant that renders properly on
DEV.to. One of these features is that every _wrap_ (virtual newline in a
paragraph to make it readable on code editor) is rendered as a newline character
on DEV.to, aka, DEV.to unexpectedly breaks a paragraph into multiple paragraphs.
To solve it, I wrote a Remark plugin to replace all _wraps_ by _spaces_.

```js
module.exports = () => (tree) => {
  visit(tree, "text", (text) => {
    text.value = text.value.replace(/\n/g, " ");
  });
};
```

The code is as simple as that but is quite re-usable, so I decided to make it an
NPM package. (It's my first package, it should be simple right?)

I called it `remark-unwrap-texts`.

## Create a TypeScript repo

Initialize a Git repo:

```bash
mkdir remark-unwrap-texts
cd remark-unwrap-texts
git init
```

Create a Github repo for it:

```bash
gh repo create phuctm97/remark-unwrap-texts --public
```

Initialize Yarn/NPM:

```bash
yarn init
name: "remark-unwrap-texts"
version: "0.0.0"
author: "Minh-Phuc Tran"
license: "MIT"
private: false
```

Add TypeScript and Prettier (as dev dependencies):

```bash
yarn add -D typescript prettier @tsconfig/recommended
```

`@tsconfig/recommended` is a base TypeScript configuration that helps you
configure your TypeScript project with minimal code.

Create a `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/recommended/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    "declaration": true
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

Done ‚ú®! I got a base TypeScript project.

## Write the logic

My package logic requires one library and a type definition package.

- Install the library:

  ```bash
  yarn add unist-util-visit
  ```

- Install the _type definition as dev dependencies_:

  ```bash
  yarn add -D @types/mdast
  ```

Write the code, with a little nice documentation:

```ts
import { Parent, Text } from "mdast";
import visit from "unist-util-visit";

/**
 * Unwraps `text` nodes in Markdown.
 *
 * Is useful when publishing to platforms like DEV.to, Medium, Hashnode, etc.
 * These platforms may not support text wraps and generate unexpected newlines.
 */
const plugin = () => (tree: Parent) => {
  visit(tree, "text", (text: Text) => {
    text.value = text.value.replace(/\n/g, " ");
  });
};

export = plugin;
```

## Add build information to package.json

Now I got the code, I need to build it into JavaScript as well as a type
declaration file. I update my `package.json` to include these:

```json
{
  // Other attributes.
  "main": "dist/index.js", // for module import/require
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts", // for TypeScript support
  "files": ["dist/**/*"], // includes only build output in the NPM package
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "prepublish": "yarn build", // Make sure output is up-to-date before publishing
    "type:check": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

## Publish the first version

Publishing with `yarn` is surprisingly simple:

- Configure an NPM account to publish to:

  ```bash
  yarn login
  username: "<npm username>"
  email: "<npm email>"
  ```

- Publish a new version:

  ```bash
  yarn publish
  New version: "0.0.1"
  password: "<npm password>"
  ... build
  ... publish
  ... Revoked token
  ```

- Yarn automatically update `package.json` with the new version, create a commit
  and a tag. All you need to do is to push them:

  ```bash
  git push && git push --tags
  ```

Done ‚ú®! I got my first NPM package ever published.

## Add documentation and tools

- Create a README:

  - Explain shortly what the package is about.

  - How-to install and use it.

  - Badges from shields.io to show the latest NPM version and the repo's license
    (also helps add a little character to the repo/package).

  - A _Build with üíô by @phuctm97_ at the end.

- Add a license and code of conduct using Github UI, it helps auto-fill the
  files for you.

- Update `package.json` to update `description` and `keywords` displayed on NPM.

  ```json
  {
    // Other attributes.
    "description": "üìã Unwraps text nodes in Markdown, is useful when publishing to platforms like DEV.to, Medium, Hashnode, etc.",
    "keywords": [
      "markdown",
      "remark",
      "commonmark",
      "unified",
      "remark-plugin",
      "unified-plugin",
      "plugin",
      "extension"
    ]
  }
  ```

- `yarn publish` again to push the updated documentation to NPM.

- Add `.github/dependabot.yml` to auto-grade dependencies:

  ```yaml
  version: 2
  updates:
    - package-ecosystem: npm
      directory: /
      schedule:
        interval: weekly
  ```

- Commit and push ‚¨ÜÔ∏è.

## Test and release v1

I've almost done, just gotta test the package in [my website implementation] to
make sure it works:

- `yarn add remark-unwrap-texts`.

- Delete my previous code and replace by `require('remark-unwrap-texts')`.

- Bump. Everything works correctly!

Go back to `remark-unwrap-texts`:

- `yarn publish` with version `1.0.0`.

- `git push && git push --tags`.

I got my first NPM package released üéâ!

Hope it helps you publish your first NPM package soon, too. For more details in
practice, you can [checkout the repository][package repo] and [the NPM
package][package on npm].
