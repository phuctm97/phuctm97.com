# Write My First Tailwind CSS Plugin

Building [my website] for a while using [Tailwind CSS], I started to have more
and more specific needs like `backdrop-filter` to create blur overlay effects,
`autofill` pseudo-class to style form fields when they have been autocompleted,
etc, and these use cases weren't covered by TailwindCSS core packages. So I had
to leave my HTML and write separate CSS files to be able to use custom CSS
properties. Although writing separate CSS is fine, I just don't like having ad
hoc CSS files here and there, which feels like an anti-pattern using Tailwind
CSS for me, especially when your theming system starts to appear everywhere. So,
I asked:

> "Why don't I just create a TailwindCSS plugin, I'll get to see how it works
> more specifically, too!".

So, here I am.

> TL;DR: It turned out pretty fun!

## [tailwindcss-autofill] variant

The first plugin adds a variant, which is to add styles when an element entered
a special state like `hover`, `focus`, etc.

The state I needed is when a form field was autocompleted.

By default, when a form field has been autocompleted, its foreground and
background will be changed to some browser defaults.

But the defaults clearly don't work with my design. The perfect way to style it
with TailwindCSS is:

```jsx
<input className="autofill:bg-white autofill:text-gray-700" />
```

So, I wrote a variant to support it. It turned out to be quite simple:

```js:tailwindcss-autofill.js
const plugin = require("tailwindcss/plugin");

const autofill = plugin(({ addVariant, e }) => {
  addVariant("autofill", ({ modifySelectors, separator }) => {
    modifySelectors(({ className }) => {
      const newClass = e(`autofill${separator}${className}`);
      return [
        `.${newClass}:-webkit-autofill`,
        `.${newClass}:-webkit-autofill:hover`,
        `.${newClass}:-webkit-autofill:focus`,
      ].join(",");
    });
  });
});

module.exports = autofill;
```

What I did is calling `addVariant` in a `tailwindcss/plugin` invocation with 2
essential things:

- A name or indicator: `autofill`. This will enable the syntax
  `autofill:text-gray-100`.

- A function that will modify the suffixed class. For example, when I use
  `autofill:text-gray-100`, this function will receive a `className` =
  `text-gray-100` and its job is to modify this class into something that will
  properly handle the targeted state, which is `-webkit-autofill` in this case.

I released this as an NPM package, [check out its repo to see
more][tailwindcss-autofill].

Now, what I needed to do is to just add this plugin into `plugins` in my
**tailwind.config.js**.

```js:tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    require("tailwindcss-autofill"),
    // Other plugins.
  ],
  variants: {
    extend: {
      // Enable `autofill` variant for essential plugins.
      borderColor: ["autofill", "dark"],
      textColor: ["autofill", "dark"],
      backgroundColor: ["autofill", "dark"],
    },
  },
};
```

This plugin works fine with `borderColor`, `focusRing`, and most others,
unfortunately, `backgroundColor` and `textColor` won't work because the browsers
use special properties that got prioritized (it's weird). So, I had to hack it
further, and the solution is to use `-webkit-text-fill-color` for the foreground
and a special `box-shadow` value to override the background.

## [tailwindcss-text-fill] and [tailwindcss-shadow-fill]

`-webkit-text-fill-color` and background fill using `box-shadow` are again
special properties that weren't supported by TailwindCSS core packages. So, I
wrote 2 other plugins, [tailwindcss-text-fill] and [tailwindcss-shadow-fill]
respectively.

This time, the two new plugins add utilities instead of variants. TailwindCSS
utilities are classes to conveniently style elements like `text-gray-100`,
`bg-red-50`, etc.

Here is the code of one of them:

```js:tailwindcss-text-fill.js
const plugin = require("tailwindcss/plugin");
const flatten = require("flatten-tailwindcss-theme");

const textFill = plugin(
  ({ addUtilities, variants, theme, e }) => {
    const colors = flatten(theme("colors"));
    const utils = Object.entries(colors).reduce(
      (res, [key, value]) =>
        Object.assign(res, {
          [`.${e(`text-fill-${key}`)}`]: {
            "-webkit-text-fill-color": value,
          },
        }),
      {}
    );
    addUtilities(utils, variants("textFill"));
  },
  { variants: { textFill: [] } }
);

module.exports = textFill;
```

This plugin will generate multiple `text-fill-{color}` classes for you, like
what `text-{color}` or `bg-{color}` did. The cool thing about this is it
dynamically respects your theme and generate classes for only colors you are
used to (colors in your current design system) and all Intellisense features on
VS Code are automatically integrated (same for the [tailwindcss-autofill]
plugin):

## Final result

Finally, it worked ðŸ”¥!

Here is how I styled my component:

```jsx
<input
  className={classNames(
    "bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100",
    "autofill:text-fill-gray-900 autofill:shadow-fill-white dark:autofill:shadow-fill-gray-800 dark:autofill:text-fill-gray-100"
  )}
/>
```

## Final thoughts

I know what you're thinking now

> A couple of different CSS properties and pseudo-classes turned into 3 JS
> plugins.

Yeah, it is true. But the fact is these plugins didn't take a lot of time or
LoCs either, especially now I've already known how to do it, it took literally
the same energy compared to creating separate CSS, class names, and maintaining
them along with other Tailwind-based configurations. On the other hand, I can
reuse these plugins for different purposes in the future, too. And also remember
that it is rare to write extra CSS when using Tailwind, the more plugins I (and
others) added, the less likely I had to write extra CSS in future projects.
