## The Problem

To prevent myself from procrastinating, I [started my blog dead simple in plain
HTML][start blog]. Although I had a fun time writing blog posts in HTML and had
[an interesting Aha! movement][start blog], writing plain HTML created quite a
few boilerplates.

## React and Next.js

To solve this problem, I needed a way to share code. In 2020, there're a lot of
different solutions, React, Vue, Svelte, to name a few. [Web Components] is
probably the closest one to HTML:

```html
<h1>Your previous HTML files</h1>
<p>can be kept as is</p>
<p>Then, use a custom tag</p>
<custom-component attr="something">Something</custom-component>
```

Unfortunately, [Web Components] is relatively new and there are little support
available compared to others, so I gave it a pass.

React was my choice because I used it before and it has probably the biggest
community compared to others. However, React is a client-side framework, which
means SEO is gonna be a problem, I needed a [React server-side rendering]
solution. [Next.js] stood out to be the best solution available.

For those who don't know Next.js yet, Next.js is a framework built on top of
React, allows you to create full-stack web applications with best-in-class
developer experience. The learning curve is relatively zero, you should
definitely check it out.

## MDX

Alright, so I got my site converted into server-side rendered JSX, I could be
fine to write more blog posts and continuously create custom components to share
code. However, JSX isn't an ideal syntax for writing in 2020. If you're a
developer you'd probably have heard of Markdown, which is a modern language
designed for writing. Markdown syntax is technically a mapping to HTML, but is
simpler, shorter, and more natural.

E.g. following Markdown and HTML produce the same result:

```md
## The Problem

To prevent myself from procrastinating, I [started my blog dead simple in plain
HTML][blog]. Although I had a fun time writing blog posts in `HTML` and had an
[interesting Aha! movement][blog], writing plain `HTML` created quite a few
boilerplates.

[MDX] is an _extended_ Markdown which allows you to import React/JSX components
into Markdown files and vice versa. It basically helps us get the best of both
things: the simplicity of Markdown and the flexibility of React. Next.js also
officially supports MDX, all MDX pages are built into static HTML pages, there's
no performance sacrifice. So, there's no reason that I shouldn't use it.
