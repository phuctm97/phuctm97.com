# How-to Integrate Plausible Analytics With Next.js and Vercel

[Plausible] is a privacy-focused analytics solution for modern websites. It and
[Fathom] are probably 2 biggest names in the space. I chose Plausible because
its pricing is more beginner-friendly and it is also open-source.

This article is a quick snippnet that I wrote to properly enable Plausible for
[my Next.js + Vercel website][my website].

## Plausible Script component

To enable Plausible, you'll need place a `script` tag in `head` of your HTML
document. To achieve that in Next.js, I create a component for easier
maintainance:

```tsx
// ~/components/plausbile-script.tsx
import Head from "next/head";
import PKG from "~/package.json"; // Load configuration from package.json.

const PlausibleScript = () => (
  <Head>
    <script
      key="plausible-script"
      src={PKG.site.plausible.scriptURL}
      async
      defer
      data-domain={new URL(PKG.homepage).host}
    />
  </Head>
);
export default PlausibleScript;
```

Then render it in my `pages/_app.(jsx|tsx)`:

```tsx
// ~/pages/_app.tsx
import PlausibleScript from "~/components/plausible-script";

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) => (
  <>
    <Head>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
      {/* Other head elements */}
    </Head>
    <PlausibleScript />
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </>
);
```

## Put configuration in `package.json`

You may realize that my `PlausibleScript` doesn't directly define script `src`,
instead it references values from `package.json`. Personally, `package.json` is
a great place to put configuration for a site or package _(the name said it,
right?)_, `package.json` isn't just for npm.

```json
// ~/package.json
{
  // ...
  "description": "🏚 Home on the Web — Everything I learned and created: software dev, programming tutorials, career, startups, and open-source.",
  "homepage": "https://phuctm97.com",
  "site": {
    "title": "Minh-Phuc Tran - Software Engineer",
    "plausible": {
      "scriptURL": "https://plausible.phuctm97.com/js/index.js"
    }
  }
  // Other values...
  // Keep configuration in package.json is also a great way to separate implementation details and configurations.
}
```

Doing this way I can also reuse standard npm values , in this case, it is
`homepage`.

## Enable only in production

Finally, I don't want views on my local and preview environment to be counted,
Plausible should only be enabled in production. To achieve that, I simply update
my `_app.tsx`:

```tsx
// ~/pages/_app.tsx
import PlausibleScript from "~/components/plausible-script";
import { IS_PRODUCTION } from "~/constants";

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) => (
  <>
    <Head>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
      {/* Other head elements */}
    </Head>
    {IS_PRODUCTION && <PlausibleScript />}
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </>
);
```

Because I'm hosting my site on [Vercel], `IS_PRODUCTION` is:

```ts
// ~/constants.ts
export const IS_PRODUCTION =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" &&
  process.env.VERCEL_ENV === "production";
```

`VERCEL_ENV` is a system environment variable defined by Vercel while building
and running your applications for specific environments (`preview` and
`production`). To be able to reference it client-side in a Next.js application,
you'll need to modify your `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  // Other configurations.
  env: {
    VERCEL_ENV: process.env.VERCEL_ENV,
  },
};
```

That's it 🤟🏻!
