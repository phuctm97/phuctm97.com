# Imagegen as a Service (Free), All Bloggers Should Have One

Hi folks, I've just built an _Imagegen (Image Generator) as a Service_. I
originally built it as a feature of [my website], then DigitalOcean hackathon
was announced, so here it is an introduction, a submission, as well as a quick
tutorial how I built it. One cool thing about this service is that it is
**open-sourced**, **easily to customize** for your needs, and can be deployed
**completely free**.

## What I built

🌌 **Imagegen (Image Generator) as a Service**, which is a (REST) API service
that can generate dynamic images for different purposes, is especially useful to
generate cover images for content distribution:

- Blogging & writing.

- Videos' thumbnails.

- Open-source repositories' social images.

- etc.

### Features:

- Markdown support.

- Dark mode enabled.

- Easily display popular brands' icons by names.

- Twitter emojis.

- Requires zero action if you publish posts to DEV.to using [DEV.to API].

- Easily share consistent styles between your content images, embed your
  name/trademark to all your content.

- Update all images with a single code change.

- Cached requests to improve performance and reduce loads.

- Multiple API versions.

- There are 2 deployment models:

  - [Node.js + Docker][github repo], which can be deployed to every cloud
    platform that supports Docker deployment, e.g. DigitalOcean. The project is
    pre-configured to deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform with a single click,
    too.

  - [Next.js + Serverless functions][next.js repo], which can be deployed
    serverlessly to platforms that support Next.js API routes as Serverless
    functions (only Vercel currently supports).

### Category Submission

Well, frankly, it's _Random Roulette_. Nevertheless, I believe it can be very
useful for personal site/portfolio (I use it on my website) and business blogs.

### App Link

[img-nodejs-dwkvo.ondigitalocean.app](https://img-nodejs-dwkvo.ondigitalocean.app)

It's an API service, so there's no UI, the API is served at `/api/v1` and
`/api/v2`, the URL above will redirect you to [the Github
repository][github repo] with details documentation.

### Screenshots

Following are some examples of using this service's API, you can copy and paste
each URL on your browser to see it yourself.

### Permissive License

The project is released under the _MIT license_ and is completely free.

## Background

I'd actually still build this project and release it open-source even if
DigitalOcean didn't organize the hackathon because it was a part of [my
website].

My website is where I'll blog very often (currently one post per ~2 days) and
document everything I did and learned as a software engineer. One thing I want
to achieve building my website is to automatically distribute my content as much
as possible, in order to maximize distribution in long term and at scale. It
currently supported auto distribution to DEV.to and Hashnode (you're probably
reading a distributed copy of [the original post]).

One part of this automation is to generate cover images for posts and let people
know where to find me. ➡️ This service 🤓

I believe automating all that is the a scalable way to grow an audience in the
long term, while I can focus my energy on high leverage tasks.

### How I built it

This article is already fairly long (compared to typical dev posts), so I'll
write a quick concept here and write complete tutorials in separate posts for
both Node.js based and Next.js based versions. There are also more details in
[the project's repository][github repo].

#### Concept

The purpose of this service is to **dynamically turn structured data into
images**. An easy way to think about it is that it is like a React component
that receives `props` then renders `visualization`, which is an `image` in this
case.

Each API is a HTTP `GET` at `/api/{version}/{...props}`:

- A `version` represents a component that requires a certain type of `props` and
  defines how an image should look.

- `props` are constructed using HTTP path and query params.

For example, `/api/v2/Hello, World!?theme=dark` will render an image in Dark
mode with title `Hello, World!`.

#### API spec

See [img-nodejs#API](https://github.com/phuctm97/img-nodejs#api).

#### Implementation

##### Generate images

To be able to render dynamic images, I used [Puppeteer] to render HTML in a
headless Chrome, then take screenshots and render them back to clients.

```ts
export default async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  const props = parseRequest(req);
  const html = getHTML(props);
  if (isHTMLDebug) {
    res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
    res.end(html);
    return;
  }

  const { fileType } = props;
  const screenshot = await getScreenshot(html, fileType, {
    width: props.width,
    height: props.height,
  });
  renderScreenshot(res, screenshot, fileType);
};
```

##### Configure Docker

There're one tricky part with deployment of this service, especially to
DigitalOcean. When developing on a laptop, it's easy because Puppeteer will
simply use your installed Chrome instance with admin access and resources
attached to it. When deploying to a cloud platform like DigitalOcean, you'll
need to install and configure a Chrome instance yourself. So, to make it easier
for others, I made a Docker image to prepare everything for you 🥳. Security was
also taken care of.

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.12

# Install dependencies to run Puppeteer in Alpine.
# See https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#running-on-alpine.
RUN apk add --no-cache \
        chromium \
        nss \
        freetype \
        freetype-dev \
        harfbuzz \
        ca-certificates \
        ttf-freefont \
        nodejs \
        yarn

# Setup app's dependencies and configure envs.
ENV CONTAINERIZED_BROWSER=/usr/bin/chromium-browser
ADD . /app/
WORKDIR /app/
RUN yarn

# Run everything as non-root user for security.
RUN addgroup -S appuser && adduser -S -g appuser appuser \
 && mkdir -p /home/appuser/Downloads /app/ \
 && chown -R appuser:appuser /home/appuser/ \
 && chown -R appuser:appuser /app/
USER appuser
CMD ["yarn", "start"]
```

##### Deploy to DigitalOcean

To make deployment even easier, I also created a `Deploy to DO` button, which
enable you to deploy the service to your account with a single click.

[![Deploy to DO][do button]][do deploy url]

One cool thing about deploying to DigitalOcean App Platform is that it will take
care of setting up proxies, port binding, and SSL (HTTPS) certificates for you.
It will also redeploy the service when you push changes to `master` branch.

### Additional Resources/Info

Special thanks to Vercel's [og-image], this project is heavily inspired by
[og-image].
