# I Changed My Mind After 2nd Try Tailwind CSS

> TL;DR: Tailwind won't help you write CSS faster or easier, it helps you think
> less.

Because I wanted to give [my plain HTML website] a little style, I gave Tailwind
CSS a shot yesterday. I spent about an hour to read through its documentation
and try it on [its playground][tailwind play]. The first impression was _"meh"_.
Tailwind is essentially a set of CSS classes mapping to a few CSS properties,
so, in order to use Tailwind, you basically have to kinda learn CSS again, which
I believe very few developers enjoy. Tailwind's creators actually knew that and
put a very interesting note:

I gave it a try, but less than an hour was probably not enough for me to shift
my mind from typical CSS properties to Tailwind classes. So, I didn't like it.

## Use typcial CSS

Because I didn't like Tailwind, today I decided to style my website using Sass
while **keeping an eye on what better and worse compared to yesterday
experience**. And, it took me almost 3 hours to finish simple styles and the
experience wasn't fun either.

##### So, what's wrong? ðŸ˜ 

I spent **more than half of the time to think of which CSS properties should be
grouped, which selectors I should do, what the class names should be**. Although
I consciously tried to avoid that, it still consumed a lot of my energy. I
couldn't really explain why, the biggest reason is probably because we always
have so many options with CSS and they keep growing over time.

## Switch back to Tailwind again

So, I switched back to Tailwind again, not that I was convinced that Tailwind
will work better, but to see again if Tailwind could solve the problems I
mentioned above.

And... yeah... it actually solved the problems:

- Tailwind comes with a very complete set of utilities, I've never had to think
  of grouping styles together. Almost every element can be styled with just
  Tailwind classes.

- I styled directly at element-level, in HTML, so I've rarely had to think of
  CSS selectors.

- Because I've never had to write CSS utilities myself, there wasn't any CSS
  "codebase" growing. Most importantly, I had nothing about CSS to **keep in my
  mind**. Now I knew it! When you write CSS, I believe "remembering its
  existence" consumes a lot of energy!

## Conclusion

I had to say it was oddly interesting. Tailwind appears to be a _"CSS
framework"_, so my expectation was _"I'll be able to write CSS faster and
easier"_, but when looking at its documentation, it doesn't look faster and
easier at all. It turned out, the problem Tailwind solved is somewhat a
physiological problem when working with CSS.

So, give it try if you've ever skeptical!
