# Make Copyable Code Block For Your Blog

A couple of days ago I implemented a feature on allow viewers on [my website] to
easily copy code blocks on my website. Personally, it is quite a useful feature
for a technical blog.

In this article, I'm going share how you can implement the same for your sites -
applicable to all React-based sites.

## `useCopyableRef` hook

Thanks to React hook functionality, I've encapsulated the logic into an easily
understandable and reusable hook:

```tsx:useCopyableRef.ts
import { useRef, useState } from "react";
import copyToClipboard from "copy-to-clipboard"; // You'll need this package: `yarn add copy-to-clipboard`.

const useCopyableRef = <T extends HTMLElement = HTMLElement>(
  delay: number = 4 * SECONDS // You may want to change this to 4000, or define SECONDS somewhere in your application.
) => {
  const ref = useRef<T>(null);

  const [isCopied, setCopied] = useState(false);
  const copy = () => {
    if (isCopied) return;

    if (!ref.current) throw new Error("Ref is nil.");
    copyToClipboard(ref.current.textContent || "");

    setCopied(true);
    setTimeout(() => setCopied(false), delay);
  };

  return { ref, isCopied, copy };
};

export default useCopyableRef;
```

It's simple, right?

## Usage in UI components

`useCopyableRef` is similar to `useRef`, additionally it returns `isCopied` and
`copy` props, which you'd need to implement your UI components.

Implementing your UI components can be as simple as the following example:

```tsx:code-block.tsx
import useCopyableRef from "~/hooks/useCopyableRef";

const CodeBlock = (props: React.HTMLProps<HTMLPreElement>) => {
  const { ref, isCopied, copy } = useCopyableRef<HTMLPreElement>();
  return (
    <>
      <pre ref={ref} {...props} />
      <button onClick={copy} disabled={isCopied}>
        {isCopied ? "Copied!" : "Copy"}
      </button>
    </>
  );
};

export default CodeBlock;
```

That's it, don't forget to style your components however you want to!
