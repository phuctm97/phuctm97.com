# How-to Keep Your Packages Always Up-to-date with Dependabot

One of the ways that I do to keep myself up-to-date with the latest technologies
is to configure automatic dependencies upgrade, which helps in 2 ways:

- Keep my products/packages always up-to-date, especially avoid potential
  vulnerability as soon as possible.

- Remind me of the technologies I'm using that have introduced new features or
  bug fixes. I can quickly look at it and learn what is newly possible.

In this article, I'll walk you through how I did it very easily and
conveniently.

Last Sunday, there were quite a few packages updated in my products.

## Dependabot

[Dependabot] is a Github bot that automatically tracks and opens PRs to update
dependencies for you. It used to be a separate product but was acquired by
Github in 2020 and became available completely for free ðŸ¤¯.

### Basic configuration

To configure it, you need just a couple of lines of code:

- Create a file `.github/dependabot.yml` in your repository.

- Add some configuration to instruct Dependabot what to update:

```yaml:dependabot.yml
version: 2

updates:
  - package-ecosystem: npm
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
```

Dependabot supports a lot of different package ecosystem including npm, Python,
Go, Rust, Maven, Docker, etc, and also Github Actions recently.
[Check out more here](https://dependabot.com/#languages).

### Interval

You can configure Dependabot to update daily, weekly, or at another specific
interval. My experience with weekly updates is the best so far.

### Workflow

After commiting your `dependabot.yml` to your repository, Dependabot will help
you update packages by opening PRs, which you can accept or reject. By receiving
updates via PRs, you get a chance to make sure that all your tests/checks are
passed before promoting to your live distribution.

Dependabot is also intelligent enough to automatically rebase PRs when you
pushed new changes to `master` (or whatever branch you configured), so you don't
always have to review and merge it right away. In fact, I often ignore it until
late in the day, when my energy level is the lowest, then I review one or
several of them.

## Badge

One little tip that I often do especially for an open-source package is to put a
badge letting the users know that this package is configured to be automatically
up-to-date.

```md
![dependabot status](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependabot-enabled-025e8c?logo=Dependabot)
```

![dependabot status](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependabot-enabled-025e8c?logo=Dependabot)

That's it. Dependabot has been super convenient for me, especially for
open-source packages that I've done implementing and don't want to think about
maintaining its dependencies. I hope it will benefit you, too!
