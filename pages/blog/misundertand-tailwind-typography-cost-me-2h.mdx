# Misunderstanding `@tailwindcss/typography` costs me 2 hours

After [falling in love with Tailwind CSS][blog about tailwind], I incorporated
it into [my website]. However, there's one thing that is both nice and annoying
about Tailwind CSS is that it has a very opinionated CSS reset, which clears
pretty much all default styles. I understand Tailwind creators' rationale for
it, having everything reset to "no style" means all styles are consciously
implemented by you, there's no surprise. So, I said "Okay, I guess I have to
implement my own 'default style' then.".

## Why having default style?

There's a reason why browsers had default styles:

> Imagine going back to the time when there was no CSS, only HTML.
>
> [HTML was first created to write and share stories][my first blog], that's why
> we had `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `p`, `strong`, `em`, etc, and because of their
> meanings (heading, paragraphs, strong, emphasized, etc), there should visual
> way to express these meanings to readers (who don't know HTML tags).

This style of writing is still mainstream on the web, most contents on the web
are still articles with headings, paragraphs, images, etc. Markdown was also
created to make this type of writing easier, every Markdown token is basically a
mapping to an HTML tag.

So, for a blog, these default styles are a must.

## What does the implementation look like?

Implementing default styles isn't difficult, however it takes time to make
things look good, especially for edge cases when these elements are stacked or
nested together. Here is my very simple one that took me ~2 hours:

```css
@layer base {
  main {
    @apply container max-w-2xl mx-auto my-10 px-4 lg:px-0;
  }
  h1,
  h2,
  h3,
  h4,
  h5,
  h6 {
    @apply font-medium pt-5 mb-2;
  }
  h1 {
    @apply text-5xl;
  }
  h2 {
    @apply text-4xl;
  }
  h3 {
    @apply text-3xl;
  }
  h4 {
    @apply text-2xl;
  }
  h5 {
    @apply text-xl;
  }
  h6 {
    @apply text-lg;
  }
  p {
    @apply font-normal text-base mb-4;
  }
  blockquote {
    @apply bg-gray-100 my-6 pt-4 pb-px px-3 border-l-8 border-gray-300;
  }
  ol,
  ul {
    @apply mb-4 pl-8;
  }
  ol {
    @apply list-decimal;
  }
  ul {
    @apply list-disc;
  }
  ol ol,
  ol ul,
  ul ol,
  ul ul {
    @apply mb-0;
  }
  ul ul,
  ol ul {
    list-style-type: circle;
  }
  pre {
    @apply mb-4 p-5 overflow-auto;
    background: #f5f2f0; /* for consistency with Prismjs theme */
  }
  code {
    @apply bg-gray-100 text-sm font-bold p-1 rounded-sm;
  }
  code:before,
  code:after {
    @apply font-normal text-xs;
    content: "`";
  }
  pre code {
    @apply bg-transparent font-normal p-0;
  }
  pre code::before,
  pre code:after {
    content: none;
  }
  hr {
    @apply my-4;
  }
  a {
    @apply text-blue-500;
  }
  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    vertical-align: middle;
  }
}
```

## Tailwind's team implemented these styles 🤦🏻‍♂️. Surprise?

After having implemented the above styles, I was okay but wasn't really happy
about how it looked, so I went around to see what others did for some
inspiration.

And, I found people suggesting the official plugin `@tailwindcss/typography`.
I'd already known that Tailwind CSS supported plugins and also knew it was the
only official plugin. However, because of the name, I thought it was something
for us to customize fonts, which wasn't my problem. But guess what,
`@tailwindcss/typography` was built exactly for the above reason - to provide
"good" default styles for typical writing HTML tags 🤦🏻‍♂️. All you need to do is
install `@tailwindcss/typography`, put that into the
`tailwindcss.config.js#plugins`, and add class `prose` to your document
top-level tag.

```html
<article class="prose">
  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
  <!-- ... All tags inside will by styled properly-->
</article>
```

The plugin supports a good amount of common scenarios: nested lists, lists with
paragraphs, code blocks, and even tables (which I didn't have time to
implement). It also allows developers to extend and customize default styles
quite easily.

So, comparing `@tailwindcss/typography` with my implementation was a no-brainer.
And I guess I've wasted 2 hours of my time because of the name. Anyway, I
learned a hard lesson that I'll remember for the rest of my life:

> Typography is not just about font styles. Typography is about making written
> content legible, readable and appealing when displayed.
